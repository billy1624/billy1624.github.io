# CodeNewb2Pro: Day002, Coding & Programming



What is coding? And how about programming? Aren’t both referring to the same thing?



### Coding

Coding is writing code to solve a real world problem! 

But without writing any code, try to imagine this… when you are on a date, after watching the best movie of the year, you find yourself extremely hungry, however your partner finished lunch just before the movie and you don’t want to put your partner aside and eat alone.

So, what would you do? Obviously, just ask your partner, right?
“Are u hungry?”

You would either got yes/ no from your partner (hopefully no third answer loll):

1.  “Yea, I can have an afternoon tea now”  Then, no problem, go and have some yummy food~
2.  “No, I’m quite full now”  Then, what you do?  Ask the same question again?

But you won’t ask the same question in the same way, right? Also, you won’t ask it over and over again in 5mins interval, right? Your partner will be mad at you, asking every 5mins is disturbing and doesn’t make any sense… although, conceptually you could reach the same goal, i.e. maybe few hours later he/ she is hungry and you both can eat together.

Coding deals with solving a real world problem, however it might not be the best solution. While Programming not only solve the problem… 



### Programming

Programming is writing code to solve a real world problem, in an efficient and elegant way.

Take the above situation as an example. Of cause you won’t ask the same question repeatedly every 5mins. A better approach would be asking the question indirectly. “Hey, look, wanna try some donut?” When you walk by a donut shop. This would be much better than asking the same thing again and again… 

Similarly, it applies to programming, we would consider:

-   Program efficiency
-   Code readability
-   Code structure & Data structure
-   … 

So, you could see that programming is much more than simply coding. In the future we will discuss all the points above.



Next, we are finally going to code, I will be explaining the simple hello world program we used for compiler testing.
