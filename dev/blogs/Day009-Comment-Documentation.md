# CodeNewb2Pro: Day009, Comment & Documentation



On a sunny afternoon, your friend call you up and ask for help on debugging the course assignment due at 12:59. Of cause you will say "Sure! Let me take a look at your code, send it to me". However, when you open the source code you discover that the code is absolutely unreadable! No comment explaining what each block of code do! What a pain to read through over 1000 lines of code without any description…



------



### How to Comment?

```
// Single line comment

/* Single line comment */

/*
  Block comment
 */

/**
 * Block comment (Javadoc style)
 */
```

Above are some of syntax to put comments in code. Mainly there are two types of comment in every programming language, `Line Comment` & `Block Comment`. Also, notice that each programming language have their unique syntax defining comments. For the example above, it shows the comment syntax in C++ & Java. For other language, you might need to go online and double check the syntax for putting comments.



### Where and What to Comment?

-   Comment at the beginning of class definition, specifying the purpose and scope of this class, what will it do and what it model
-   Comment at the beginning of function definition, specifying the functionality of the function, together with the input parameters and return value of it
-   Comment at special if statement, such as some error checking if statement, specifying the purpose of this if statement
-   Comment at line or block of code that you think others will have difficulties to understand!



### Comment Tags

```
// TODO: brbrbrbbrbr
// FIXME: brbrbbrbrbrbr
```

Some useful tags for programmer such as `TODO` and `FIXME`, and many other useful tags. Some IDE will have special syntax highlight or even a panel for you to find the line containing the tag. For example, the `TODO` tag indicate some task needs to be done, and `FIXME` indicate something needs to be fix. Very intuitive, right?



### Comment & Documentation

There is some standard for putting comment on code, more specifically it called documentation. For example in Java, we have JavaDoc, you can see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm) for more info.
