#CodeNewb2Pro: Day000, A Journey of Coding Newbie Becoming a Pro



Hi there, welcome to my very first post on Medium.



### CodeNewb2Pro

I always want to share my thought and experience on programming. This is a series of posts recording my experience on coding, starting from the fundamental then to more advanced topic of programming. I’m not a super senior programmer though, I’m just a college student. Hopefully, through the series people like me, a junior programmer can gradually become a pro, and people want to learn programming can start by learning fundamental programming concepts then eventually become a pro.



### Bio

Currently a Year 3 student of BEng in Computer Science at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Before entering HKUST, I was a Associate Degree student of ASci in Information System Development at Community College of City University (CCCU). I completed 3 web development summer internships on 2016-2018, I was working for a HK online grocery startup, responsible for developing and maintaining both frontend (jQuery) and backend (PHP & MySQL) of the company web application.
